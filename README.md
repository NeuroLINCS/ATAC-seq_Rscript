# NeuroLINCS RNA-seq differential expression and ATAC-seq differential site analysis tutorials


This repository contains tutorials for differential expression for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.
Refer to RNA_DEseq2.md for step-by-step instructions on how to run the RNA-seq analysis.
RNA_DEseq2.Rmd contains the R markdown code used to generate RNA_DEseq2.html.


Refer to ATAC_diffbind.md for step-by-step instructions on how to run the ATAC-seq analysis. 
sample_sheet_diffbind_example.csv is needed to run the example code for ATAC_seq.
ATAC_diffbind.Rmd contains the R markdown code used to generate ATAC_diffbind.html.
